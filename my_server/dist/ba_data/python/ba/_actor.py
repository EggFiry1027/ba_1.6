    Category: Gameplay Classes

    Actors act as controllers, combining some number of ba.Nodes,
    ba.Textures, ba.Sounds, etc. into a high-level cohesive unit.

    Some example actors include the Bomb, Flag, and Spaz classes that
    live in the bastd.actor.* modules.

    One key feature of Actors is that they generally 'die'
    (killing off or transitioning out their nodes) when the last Python
    reference to them disappears, so you can use logic such as:

    # Create a flag Actor in our game activity:
    from bastd.actor.flag import Flag
    self.flag = Flag(position=(0, 10, 0))

    # Later, destroy the flag.
    # (provided nothing else is holding a reference to it)
    # We could also just assign a new flag to this value.
    # Either way, the old flag disappears.
    self.flag = None

    This is in contrast to the behavior of the more low level ba.Nodes,
    which are always explicitly created and destroyed and don't care
    how many Python references to them exist.

    Note, however, that you can use the ba.Actor.autoretain() method
    if you want an Actor to stick around until explicitly killed
    regardless of references.

    Another key feature of ba.Actor is its handlemessage() method, which
    takes a single arbitrary object as an argument. This provides a safe way
    to communicate between ba.Actor, ba.Activity, ba.Session, and any other
    class providing a handlemessage() method.  The most universally handled
    message type for Actors is the ba.DieMessage.

    # Another way to kill the flag from the example above:
    # We can safely call this on any type with a 'handlemessage' method
    # (though its not guaranteed to always have a meaningful effect).
    # In this case the Actor instance will still be around, but its exists()
    # and is_alive() methods will both return False.
